scripts
=======

Various scripts that I use. More will be added over time.

### fresh_install

A script for updating a fresh Fedora install, installing all of my needed packages, installing Dropbox and their python script, grab my configuration files from github, set the shell to zsh, and set the hostname if Anaconda failed to do so. 

#### To-Do

- Change initial runlevel to 3 instead of 5,
- Add .xinitrc, .xkbmap, and .Xcompose to dotfiles.
- Include additional git repos, and move them into a dedicated folder.
- Make package groups optional.
