scripts
=======

Various scripts that I use.

- fresh_install
    A script for updating a fresh Fedora install, installing all of my needed packages, installing Dropbox and their python script, grab my configuration files from github, set the shell to zsh, and set the hostname if Anaconda failed to do so.
