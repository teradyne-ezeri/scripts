scripts
=======

Various scripts that I use. More will be added over time.

### fresh_install_fedora and fresh_install_ubuntu

A script for updating a fresh Fedora or Ubuntu install, grabbing all of my needed packages, Dropbox and their python script, grab my configuration files from github, set the shell to zsh, For Fedora, this also sets the hostname if Anaconda failed to do so. 

#### To-Do

- Fedora: Change initial runlevel to 3 instead of 5,
- Add .xinitrc, .xkbmap, and .Xcompose to dotfiles.
- Include additional git repos, and move them into a dedicated folder.
- Make package groups optional.
